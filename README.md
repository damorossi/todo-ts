# Please, after downloading this and the backend version (and follow respective's instructions), 
# install dependencies (npm i or yarn)

# as this, please consider that if you choose to run this in a different port,  you must add / modify that in be server for CORS pourposes to avoid errors.
# As also remember if you change the backend port ( current is 4000), you must change this in the client-api.service.ts file

# USAGE: 
# The list is by default and this does not work with routes.
# To create hit the 'Create todo' button on top.
# To edit the title you must double click the title to open it.
